# static-comp2

This webpage was completed using only HTML and CSS. It features a header with A title, nav bar, and another link for the admin. In addition there are several icons. I divided the left side of the header with the navs, and the right side which held the title and admin. This made the items more controllable to sit next to eachother and target individually. The tricky part in terms of responsiveness was when the pixel rate got lower and they 3 items began to overlap. I used flex-direction: column-reverse; to solve this issue. From there the 3 items stacked nicely with eachother.

In the body, there is an H1 of one of the links found on the nav bar, although the links are un-responsive. Then there are 8 cards which were each contained in an article. From there I divided the card into 2, the top in a section and the bottom in a section. From there all of the body, pictures and icons were all stored in their own div, which made it easier to target each part of the card to make it more responsive. I tried to choose pictures with smaller pixel rates to make them a little easier to adjust as a background image, but I ran into some issues. All of the images were stored with a 'cover' style, and some became a little warped. Besides that I feel the cards were pretty responsive and acted well.
